## Project Zoom Room Info.
Each Round lasts 20 minutes (30 mins at max), 
so the first Round will start in the beginning of the lesson 
(15:30 if it is Thursday, while 14:30 if Friday), 
the second Round will start after the first one, so if the lesson is on Thursday, 
first round will start at 15:30 and second round will start at (at max) 16:00, 
and for the third Round (at max) 16:30. Similarly, for Friday (when there is a meeting).
